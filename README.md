# Usage

sbt "run file-path"

### Working examples:

### This one is with the tiny example dataset from the PDF
sbt"run ./data/data.txt"

### This one is starting to take a while
sbt "run ./data/data_small.txt"

### For the following you should copy the data_big.txt file to the data folder, I excluded it from git because it is too big. 
sbt "run ./data/data_big.txt"
